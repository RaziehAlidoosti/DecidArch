# DecidArch
This repository contains the material of DecidArch, a game to teach software architecture design decision making.

DecidArch was developed at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam to achieve three learning objectives, namely:
1. Create awareness about the rationale involved in design decision making;
2. Enable appreciation of the reasoning behind candidate design decisions proposed by others;
3. Create awareness about interdependencies between design decisions.

For more information on the game, you can refer to the [publication describing the up-to-date game (DevicArch V2)](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/74433839/MARCH_2019.pdf) and its [original publication (DecidArch V1)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/211328056.pdf).

The material of the up-to-date game, and further supporting material, can be found at the [DecidArch-V2 (MARCH19)](https://github.com/S2-group/DecidArch/tree/main/Decidarch-V2%20(MARCH19)).

The material of the outdated version of the game can instead be found in the folder [DecidArch-V1 (HICSS19)](https://github.com/S2-group/DecidArch/tree/main/DecidArch-V1%20(HICSS19)).
